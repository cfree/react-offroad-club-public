      <h2>General Run Information</h2>
      <p>
        Here’s a description of a typical day run with the 4-Players: You
        sign-up to attend a Run on our website. Our Run Leader(s) prepare for
        the run and meet you at the rally point at the designated time. Once
        everyone has assembled, the Run Leader goes through the scenario for the
        day, including trail needs and driving challenges. We head to the
        trailhead as a group, and then have loads of fun driving through and
        exploring the area. We typically take several short breaks along the
        way, and often eat lunch at a picturesque location near the trail. Once
        the trail is done, everyone regroups and decides if there are
        after-the-trail food or sundries, or perhaps a different way back to the
        city. Take look below at what our Run Leaders and you do while on the
        trails with us.

      <h3>Run Leaders</h3>
      <p>
        Run Leaders are assigned to each of our runs. They are responsible for
        planning and leading the run for those who’ve signed up. Here’s a quick
        list of their duties.

      <h3>Attendees</h3>
      <p>
        Runs are intended to take you to amazing spots in our area, challenge
        your driving skills, and provide some outdoor off-road fun. As a run
        attendee, you have responsibilities to the Run Leader and other
        attendees. Here’s a quick list of your duties.

      <div className="columns">
        <div className="col1">
          <h4>On the Run</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Ensure your rig is properly maintained before embarking.</li>
            <li>Carry food, water, and extra warm clothing.</li>
            <li>
              Plan for emergencies by having an emergency or repair kit on the
              trail.
            </li>
            <li>Carry a radio for communication.</li>
            <li>
              Follow the leader: stay a close but safe distance from the rig in
              front of you.
            </li>
            <li>
              Monitor the rig behind you. Slow down or stop if they fall out of
              your view. At hard turns, ensure the rig behind you follows the
              turn off.
            </li>
            <li>Study the trail ahead of time.</li>
            <li>Assist with breakdowns or emergencies.</li>

            <strong>Radios</strong>: We use two-way radios like the{' '}

            or equivalent. We monitor channel 22 on the trail. (Very few members
            have CBs in their rigs, but that number is increasing.)
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Repair Kit</strong>: Know what tools you’ll need for your
            rig to do basic trail repairs if you breakdown or get damaged. It
            takes time to build up these kits. Think ahead how you can fix a
            flat, tie up a loose/broken part, or ways to limp off the trail to a
            repair shop.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Emergency Kit</strong>: Include things like extra food,
            water, shelter, fire/warmth, maps, etc. It takes time to build up
            these kits. Think ahead how you’ll handle a late-into-the-night
            repair with yet 20 miles of off-road before reaching pavement.

      <h3>Where We Meet Up</h3>

        <strong>No 4x4 Vehicle?</strong> That's okay! Our members commonly have
        space for ride-alongs and it’s a great way to be immersed in nature and
        meet some of the guys in the club.{' '}
